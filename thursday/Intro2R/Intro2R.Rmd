Topic 1. Basic data types in R
====================================================

## Simple variables: variables that have a numeric value, a character value (such as a string), or a logical value (True or False)

Examples of numeric values.
```{r}
# assign number 150 to variable a.
a <- 150
a
# assign a number in scientific format to variable b.
b <- 3e-2
b
```

Examples of character values.
```{r}
# assign a string "Professor" to variable title
title <- "Professor"
title
# assign a string "Hello World" to variable hello
hello <- "Hello World"
hello
```

Examples of logical values.
```{r}
# assign logical value "TRUE" to variable is_female
is_female <- TRUE
is_female
# assign logical value "FALSE" to variable is_male
is_male <- FALSE
is_male
# assign logical value to a variable by logical operation
age <- 20
is_adult <- age > 18
is_adult
```

To find out the type of variable.
```{r}
class(is_female)
# To check whether the variable is a specific type
is.numeric(hello)
is.numeric(a)
is.character(hello)
```

The rule to convert a logical variable to numeric: TRUE > 1, FALSE > 0
```{r}
as.numeric(is_female)
as.numeric(is_male)
```

R does not know how to convert a numeric variable to a character variable.
```{r}
b
as.character(b)
```


## Vectors: a vector is a combination of multiple values(numeric, character or logical) in the same object. A vector is created using the function c() (for concatenate).

```{r}
friend_ages <- c(21, 27, 26, 32)
friend_ages

friend_names <- c("Mina", "Ella", "Anna", "Cora")
friend_names
```

One can give names to the elements of a vector.
```{r}
# assign names to a vector by specifying them
names(friend_ages) <- c("Mina", "Ella", "Anna", "Carla")
friend_ages

# assign names to a vector using another vector
names(friend_ages) <- friend_names
friend_ages
```

Or One may create a vector with named elements from scratch.
```{r}
friend_ages <- c(Mina=21, Ella=27, Anna=26, Cora=32)
friend_ages
```

To find out the length of a vector:
```{r}
length(friend_ages)
```

To access elements of a vector: by index, or by name if it is a named vector.
```{r}
friend_ages[2]
friend_ages["Ella"]

friend_ages[c(1,3)]
friend_ages[c("Mina", "Anna")]

# selecting elements of a vector by excluding some of them.
friend_ages[-3]
```

To select a subset of a vector can be done by logical vector.
```{r}
my_friends <- c("Mina", "Ella", "Anna", "Cora")
my_friends
has_child <- c("TRUE", "TRUE", "FALSE", "TRUE")
has_child

my_friends[has_child == "TRUE"]
```

*** NOTE: a vector can only hold elements of the same type.


## Matrices: A matrix is like and Excel sheet containing multiple rows and columns. It is used to combine vectors of the same type.

```{r}
col1 <- c(1,3,8,9)
col2 <- c(2,18,27,10)
col3 <- c(8,37,267,19)

my_matrix <- cbind(col1, col2, col3)
my_matrix

rownames(my_matrix) <- c("row1", "row2", "row3", "row4")
my_matrix

t(my_matrix)
```

To find out the dimension of a matrix:
```{r}
ncol(my_matrix)
nrow(my_matrix)
dim(my_matrix)
```


Accessing elements of a matrix is done in similar ways to accessing elements of a vector.

```{r}
my_matrix[1,3]
my_matrix["row1", "col3"]
```

```{r}
my_matrix[1,]
my_matrix[,3]
```

```{r}
my_matrix[col3 > 20,]
```


Calculations with matrices.

```{r}
my_matrix * 3
log10(my_matrix)
```

Total of each row.
```{r}
rowSums(my_matrix)
```

Total of each column.
```{r}
colSums(my_matrix)
```

It is also possible to use the function apply() to apply any statistical functions to rows/columns of matrices. The advantage of using apply() is that it can take a function created by user.

The simplified format of apply() is as following:

apply(X, MARGIN, FUN)

X: data matrix
MARGIN: possible values are 1 (for rows) and 2 (for columns)
FUN: the function to apply on rows/columns

To calculate the mean of each row.

```{r}
apply(my_matrix, 1, mean)
```

To calculate the median of each row

```{r}
apply(my_matrix, 1, median)
```


## Factors: a factor represents categorical or groups in data. The function factor() can be used to create a factor variable.

```{r}
friend_groups <- factor(c(1,2,1,2))
friend_groups
```

In R, categories are called factor levels. The function levels() can be used to access the factor levels.

```{r}
levels(friend_groups)
```

Change the factor levels.

```{r}
levels(friend_groups) <- c("best_friend", "not_best_friend")
friend_groups
```

Change the order of levels.

```{r}
levels(friend_groups) <- c("not_best_friend", "best_friend")
friend_groups
```

By default, the order of factor levels is taken in the order of numeric or alphabetic.

```{r}
friend_groups <- factor(c("not_best_friend", "best_friend", "not_best_friend", "best_friend"))
friend_groups
```

The factor levels can be specified when creating the factor, if the order does not follow the default rule.

```{r}
friend_groups <- factor(c("not_best_friend", "best_friend", "not_best_friend", "best_friend"), levels=c("not_best_friend", "best_friend"))
friend_groups
```

If you want to know the number of individuals at each levels, there are two functions.

```{r}
summary(friend_groups)
```

```{r}
table(friend_groups)
```


## Data frames: a data frame is like a matrix but can have columns with different types (numeric, character, logical).

A data frame can be created using the function data.frame().

```{r}
# creating a data frame using previously defined vectors
friends <- data.frame(name=friend_names, age=friend_ages, child=has_child)
friends
```

To check whether a data is a data frame, use the function is.data.frame().

```{r}
is.data.frame(friends)
```

```{r}
is.data.frame(my_matrix)
```

One can convert a object to a data frame using the function as.data.frame().

```{r}
class(my_matrix)
```

```{r}
my_data <- as.data.frame(my_matrix)
class(my_data)
```

A data frame can be transposed in the similar way as a matrix.

```{r}
my_data
```

```{r}
t(my_data)
```

To obtain a subset of a data frame can be done in similar ways as we have discussed: by index, by row/column names, or by logical values.

```{r}
friends["Mina",]
```

```{r}
# The columns of a data frame can be referred to by the names of the columns
friends
friends$age
friends[friends$age > 26,]
```

```{r}
friends[friends$child == "TRUE",]
```

Function subset() can also be used to get a subset of a data frame.

```{r}
# select friends that are older than 26
subset(friends, age > 26)

# select the information of the ages of friends
subset(friends, select=age)
```


A data frame can be extended.

```{r}
# add a column that has the information on the marrital status of friends
friends$married <- c("YES", "YES", "NO", "YES")
friends
```

A data frame can also be extended using the functions cbind() and rbind().

```{r}
# add a column that has the information on the salaries of friends
cbind(friends, salary=c(4000, 8000, 2000, 6000))
```

## Lists: a list is an ordered collection of objects, which can be any type of R objects (vectors, matrices, data frames).

A list can be created using the function list().

```{r}
my_list <- list(mother="Sophia", father="John", sisters=c("Anna", "Emma"), sister_age=c(5, 10))
my_list
```

```{r}
# names of elements in the list
names(my_list)
```

```{r}
# number of elements in the list
length(my_list)
```

To access elements of a list can be done using its name or index.

```{r}
my_list$mother
```

```{r}
my_list[["mother"]]
```

```{r}
my_list[[1]]
```

```{r}
my_list[[3]]
```

```{r}
my_list[[3]][2]
```


Topic 2. Import and export data in R
====================================================

R base function read.table() is a general funciton that can be used to read a file in table format. The data will be imported as a data frame.

```{r}
# If you have downloaded the raw_counts.txt file to your working directory, you may use the following command to read it in.
data <- read.table(file="raw_counts.txt", sep="\t", header=T, stringsAsFactors=F)

# There is a more convenient way to read files from the internet.
data <- read.table(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucdavis-bioinformatics-training/2017-August-Variant-Analysis-Workshop/master/friday/Intro2R/raw_counts.txt", sep="\t", header=T, stringsAsFactors=F)

```

Take a look at the beginning part of the data frame.
```{r}
head(data)
```


Depending on the format of the file, several variants of read.table() are available to make reading a file easier.

read.csv(): for reading "comma separated value" files (.csv).

read.csv2(): variant used in countries that use a comma "," as decimal point and a semicolon ";" as field separators.

read.delim(): for reading "tab separated value" files (".txt"). By default, point(".") is used as decimal point.

read.delim2(): for reading "tab separated value" files (".txt"). By default, comma (",") is used as decimal point.

```{r}
# If you have downloaded the raw_counts.csv file to your working directory, you may use the following command to read it in.
data2 <- read.csv(file="raw_counts.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)

# Otherwise, you may read the file by providing the url to the read.csv() function.
data2 <- read.csv(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucdavis-bioinformatics-training/2017-August-Variant-Analysis-Workshop/master/friday/Intro2R/raw_counts.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)

# To look at the file:
head(data2)
```



R base function write.table() can be used to export a data frame or matrix to a file.

```{r}
# To write to a file called "output.txt" in your current working directory.
write.table(data2[1:20,], file="output.txt", sep="\t", quote=F, row.names=T, col.names=T)
```

It is also possible to export data to a csv file.

write.csv()

write.csv2()


```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat("\\newpage")
```


Topic 3. Functions in R
====================================================
## Invoking a function by its name, followed by the parenthesis and zero or more arguments.

```{r}
# to find out the current working directory
getwd()

# to set a different working directory, use setwd
setwd("/Users/jli/Desktop")

# to list all variables in the environment
ls()

# to create a vector from 2 to 3, usin increment of 0.1
seq(2, 3, by=0.1)

# to create a vector with repeated elements
rep(1:3, times=3)
rep(1:3, each=3)

# to get help information on a function in R: ?function.name()
?seq()
?sort()
?rep()

```

## One useful function to find out information on a variable: str()

```{r}
str(data2)
```


## Two special functions: lapply() and sapply()
### lapply() is to apply a given function to every element of a list and obtain a list as results.
### The difference between lapply() and apply() is that lapply() can be applied on objects like dataframes, lists or vectors. Function apply() only works on an array of dimension 2 or a matrix.

#### To check the syntax of using lapply():
```{r}
#?lapply()

data <- as.data.frame(matrix(rnorm(49), ncol=7), stringsAsFactors=F)
dim(data)
lapply(1:dim(data)[1], function(x){sum(data[x,])})
apply(data, MARGIN=1, sum)
lapply(1:dim(data)[1], function(x){log10(sum(data[x,]))})
```

### The function sapply() works like function lapply(), but tries to simplify the output to the most elementary data structure that is possible. As a matter of fact, sapply() is a "wrapper" function for lapply(). By default, it returns a vector.

```{r}
# To check the syntax of using sapply():
#?sapply()

sapply(1:dim(data)[1], function(x){log10(sum(data[x,]))})
```

### If the "simplify" parameter is turned off, sapply() will produced exactly the same results as lapply(), in the form of a list. By default, "simplify" is turned on.
```{r}
sapply(1:dim(data)[1], function(x){log10(sum(data[x,]))}, simplify=FALSE)
```


Topic 4. Basic statistics in R
====================================================

```{r echo=FALSE, results= 'asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(data.frame(Description=c("Mean", "Standard deviation", "Variance", "Minimum", "Maximum", "Median", "Range of values: minimum and maximum", "Sample quantiles", "Generic function", "Interquartile range"), R_function=c("mean()", "sd()", "var()", "min()", "max()", "median()", "range()", "quantile()", "summary()", "IQR()"), stringsAsFactors=F), align='c')
```

Calculate the mean expression for each sample.

```{r}
apply(data, 2, mean)
```

Calculate the range of expression for each sample.

```{r}
apply(data, 2, range)
```

Calculate the quantiles of each samples.

```{r}
apply(data, 2, quantile)
```


Topic 5. Simple data visulization in R
====================================================

Scatter plot and line plot can be produced using the function plot().

```{r}
x <- c(1:50)
y <- 1 + sqrt(x)/2
plot(x,y)

plot(x,y, type="l")

# plot both the points and lines
## first plot points
plot(x,y)
lines(x,y, type="l")
## lines() can only be used to add information to a graph, while it cannot produce a graph on its own.

```


boxplot() can be used to summarize data.

```{r}
boxplot(data, xlab="Sample ID", ylab="Raw Counts")
```

```{r}
x <- rnorm(1000)
boxplot(x)
```

hist() can be used to create histograms of data.
```{r}
hist(x)

# use user defined break points
hist(x, breaks=seq(range(x)[1]-1, range(x)[2]+1, by=0.5))
```

```{r}
# clear plotting device/area
dev.off()
```


Topic 6. Install packages in R
====================================================

There are two ways to install bioconductor packages in R: biocLite(), install.packages()

```{r}
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
## install core packages
#biocLite()
## install specific packages
#biocLite("RCircos")
#biocLite(c("IdeoViz", "devtools"))
```

If it's the first time you invoke the above "source" command, you should see a very similar screen as in the following picture:
![source biocLite command showcase](./sourcebiocLite.png)


```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2", repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```

Install from source of github.
```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("stephenturner/qqman")
```

# biocLite() is the recommended way to install Bioconductor packages.

* Bioconductor has a repository and release schedule that differ from R (Bioconductor has a ‘devel’ branch to which new packages and updates are introduced, and a stable ‘release’ branch emitted once every 6 months to which bug fixes but not new features are introduced). This mismatch causes that the version detected by install.packages() is sometimes not the most recent 'release'.

* A consequence of the distince 'devel' branch is that install.packages() sometimes points only to the 'release' repository, while users might want to have access to the leading-edge features in the develop version.

* An indirect consequence of Bioconductor's structured release is that packages generally have more extensive dependences with one another.

# To update the installed Bioconductor packages.
```{r}
#biocLite("BiocUpgrade")
```


Topic 7. Save data in R session
====================================================

#### To save history in R session

```{r}
savehistory(file="Sept6.history")

#loadhistory(file="Sept6.history")
```

#### To save objects in R session

```{r}
save(list=c("x", "data"), file="Sept6.RData")

#load("Sept6.RData")
```
